    "“Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that's based on artificial neural networks. The learning process is deep because the structure of artificial neural networks consists of multiple input, output, and hidden layers. Each layer contains units that transform the input data into information that the next layer can use for a certain predictive task. Thanks to this structure, a machine can learn through its own data processing.” - Microsoft, 2022\n",

    "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are composed of artificial neurons, or nodes, that mimic the learning paths of the human brain. The ANN can contain any number of neurons organized in the form of any number of interconnected layers. The first layer, the input layer, contains nodes representing the features in the dataset used to train the model. The final layer, or output layer, indicates the dimentionality of the target variable. The layers between the input and output are hidden layers containing connections modeled as weights, which represent the neuron's interpretation of feature importance in predicting the output value. ANNs also use Bias, a constant parameter which helps adjust the weighted sum of the inputs to the neuron for the best fit on the data. Lastly, Activation Functions are non-linear transformations that define the output of a neuron before sending it to the next layer of neurons or finalizing the output determination of the model.\n",

    "There are many different libraries associated with Deep Learning in Python, however, PyTorch and Tensorflow are two of the most common open-source frameworks used to create Neural Networks. While Tensorflow is an end-to-end open-source library for ML and DL, interfacing is accomplished through a library called Keras. There are 2 primary ways to create a Keras model:\n",
